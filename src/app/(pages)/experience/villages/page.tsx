Nabji's history dates back to Guru Rinpoche's first visit to Bhutan, during which he made King Nawoche of Assam, India, and King Sindhu Raja of Bumthang an oath to live in harmony. Nabji Lhakhang was built by Khandro Tashi Khyidren, daughter of King Sindhu Raja, with the help of Guru Rinpoche. A tree near the entrance is believed to be Guru Rinpoche's walking staff."

The Monpa community in Trongsa is spread across three villages: Jangbi, Phumzur, and Wamling, with approximately 375 Monpas. They inhabit the Mangdue and Wangdue valleys in central Bhutan and are often considered some of the country's first inhabitants. The Monpas are a close-knit community, living and working together in groups. They follow a joint family system, where the male head of the household typically makes family decisions. Traditionally, the Monpas wore a unique dress called the 'Pangay,' although this is now being replaced by the national dress. Their language, Monkha, is distinct and does not resemble any other language in Bhutan, though it shares roots with the Tibeto-Burman language family, similar to other languages spoken in the region."
