                        The trailhead is just 30 minutes north of Trongsa to one of Bhutan's most rewarding hikes.
                        This trek winds through pristine forests and sacred grounds, climbing 930m to reach heights of 3,410m.
                    </p>
                    <p className='pt-2'>
                        The journey begins at Dozhong Goemba, where ancient stories tell of a sacred stone
                        tub used by the local deity Yulha Menmo. With its simple yet elegant architecture,
                        this traditional temple holds deep historical connections to Bhutan's spiritual leaders.
                    </p>
                    <p className='pt-2'>
                        As the trail climbs, you'll walk through forests rich with wildlife. Lucky
                        hikers might spot the brilliant Himalayan Monal, Blood Pheasant, or elusive
                        Satyr Tragopan among the ancient conifers and blooming rhododendrons.
                    </p>
                    <p className='pt-2'>
                        Past a rustic yak herders' camp lies Singaythang - the Place of Lion - marked
                        by a distinctive lion-shaped rock formation. Here, the views reveal the mighty
                        Gangkhar Puensum (7,570m), Bhutan's highest unclimbed peak, alongside sweeping
                        vistas of traditional villages and the Trongsa valley below.
                    </p>
                    <p className='pt-2'>
                        The trail then descends to Taphey Goemba, where eight monks maintain
                        their meditation retreat around a magnificent two-storey statue of the 1001-armed
                        Chenresig. Your journey concludes at the historic Yuling Monastery, a sacred site
                        chosen by the great master Yongzin Ngagi Wangchuk in 1541, still housing precious
                        relics from his time.

                        This trek perfectly balances natural wonders with Bhutan's rich cultural heritage,
                        offering an unforgettable journey through the heart of the kingdom.

                        Visit in spring (January-May) to witness hillsides ablaze with rhododendron
                        blooms, or choose autumn and winter (October-December) for crystal-clear views
                        of snow-capped Himalayas.
